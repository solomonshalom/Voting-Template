                This is my 1st year in 21kSchool. I have been online schooling in my previous grades.
                So that's why I have experience of online classes. 
                By participating in Student Council, it would help me in developing my leadership skills and getting aware of new ideas and having the opportunity to help others and the school.
                I am awaiting for the opportunity of being part with 21k Student Council and a wonderful experience with them.

                This is my first year at 21K, but not my first year being a council member.
                I have been part of student council since grade 7 in different roles. 
                Last year, I was Assistant Head-Girl of my previous school.
                During the last three years , I've been involved in many activities as a student council member. 
                I am a blackbelt in Taekwondo and have represented my school at State and National Levels. 
                I have won many speech and creative writing competitions. 
                I have worked on various events and helped identify students who needed more attention and helped them to the best of my capacity. I have written many articles, stories and poems for my school magazine. As the school President or Vice President I will introduce ideas for events, fun workshops and we'll work together to help weaker students excel and prove just how dedicated the council can be in making 21K the best place to be in. I stay in Mumbai with my parents and my three super-naughty younger brothers thanks to whom I have learned the hard way how to be a leader. Both of my parents are entrepreneurs. I am looking forward to have an amazing year at 21K and I want to be helpful and I want us all to build memories we'll remember and treasure forever

                I am from Class 12 MA and this is my last year of high school.
                 Some of the things I do for fun is dancing, digital drawing, basket ball, roller skating and swimming. 
                 Mental health is very important to me as I suffered with my own and I still do and that's how I came to an conclusion that I want to pursue psychology as my major in college.
                  I settled to apply for the posts mentioned above, to finish my high school years with a new experience and it will also help me add some impact to my college application. 
                  One of my major goals in life is to go to foreign as an undergrad, which makes this my last year to work my hardest to get into a good college. Apart from psychology, I also caught interest in business. In my view except from all the theoretical studies, business also taught me how to be a great leader, how to take in charge but also how to manage my time and finance! Apart from all of this, I also like to journal. Journaling is a fun productive activity I do when I have to get my life together. I like to write down what I do on a daily basis but also note down all the events coming up! This not only helps with my anxiety but also helps me manage my time better! I would also like to emphasise on my dancing life. I have been dancing since I was five! I have learned hiphop, freestyle, jazz, some folk dances of India and contemporary I have not only been a student in the dancing field but also a teacher. Dance is a art to express your emotion! Being a teacher not only helped me express my emotions to my students but also learn more about my dance mates!
                   it was a great opportunity and I will always cherish it!
                   But here were the few things to know about me, maybe more than a few!

                This is my first year at 21k and the first time I am taking part in student council elections, 
                because of last year’s lockdown I wasn’t able to apply for it. 
                As I have been studying online for 3 years now, I understand how online classes, systems and people react to it. 
                In my previous school, I was the captain of my school’s football and gymnastics team.
                I even was a vocalist and lead vocalist for my school’s choir.
                Through such experiences, I know what it is like to be under a captain and the captain themselves.
                If I get elected, I would love to listen to each member of my group and clear their doubts or fix any problems they are facing under my power. I will make sure everybody feels equal in Microsoft house.
                Nobody will feel alone or left out and as a team we will make sure that we perform better than our limits.
                Thank you! Regards Kriti Vohra
